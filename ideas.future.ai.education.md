I believe in scouring a body of text for information and being
able to parse it for its content. I've seen the idea with a
youtube video using pinecone and langchain    .

Then, have someone summarize it in the simplest mental model 
possible. ELI5 that thing; and then embellish it with a `mood`
or even use a voice to use it. 

I want a program that can create a semantic tree from text
according to any given schema ( because people want to 
understand things from their perspective first, the perspective
of others last )

You can build a body of knowledge with intent and have instant
access to the things you know, like the movie "Limitless"
