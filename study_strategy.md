notes should ultimately turn into a study guide for for exams
as such, they need to be

* comprehensive: it covers all topics in the course
* structured: it is grouped in a way that's easy for me to understand & review
* definitive: key concepts and facts referenced are available in the notes
* practice: act as a space to practice for both parts of the exam


_____________________________________________________________________________

To be **comprehensive** I will take notes of everything I read as I go.
When I read a paragraph, I will ask "what question does this answer?"
and write down the both the question and the summarized answer like so.

# what is variable scope
{{{ different 'space' where variables can be accessed

}}}

The first in the fold should be refactored into a bullet point

_____________________________________________________________________________

to be structured, I will group related concepts together in a way that makes
sense to me. For example, I may want to create a high-level summary of the
course and create folds after the introduction of a concept:

Programs may need to decide between different actions or 
{{{ statements,
}}}
and what action gets taken depends on the evaluated value of
{{{ expressions   
}}}


The paragraph provides a structure in which to understand everything
_____________________________________________________________________________

To be definitive, key concepts from the course will be copied verbatim into
the notes. The preference is to put them into fold headings so they appear
as bullet points. I'll also be explaining topics in the technical language
they use so I can adopt the same technical style. Lastly, key code examples
in the book will be copied as reference so I don't need to refer back to the
course itself.

> Key concept explained here
{{{ code example: numbers are immutable
```ruby

```
}}}

To act as a space for practice, 



101 covers the following


What are expressions and what is their purpose?
  * types of expressions
  * operator types

What is a statement?

What is control flow and how do they work with expressions
  * different types of flow structures
