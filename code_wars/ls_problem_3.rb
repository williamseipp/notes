# Write a method named to_weird_case that accepts a string, and
# returns the same sequence of characters with every 2nd character
# in every third word converted to uppercase. Other characters
# should remain the same.

# Examples:

p to_weird_case('Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing') ==
                'Lorem Ipsum iS simply dummy tExT of the pRiNtInG'
p to_weird_case(
  'It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted') ==
  'It is a long established fAcT that a rEaDeR will be dIsTrAcTeD'
p to_weird_case('aaA bB c') == 'aaA bB c'
p to_weird_case(
  'Miss Mary Poppins word is supercalifragilisticexpialidocious') ==
  'Miss Mary POpPiNs word is sUpErCaLiFrAgIlIsTiCeXpIaLiDoCiOuS'

# The tests above should print "true".
