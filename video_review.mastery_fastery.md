# note-taking system
* as you read a paragraph ask yourself "what question is this answering?"
    write down that question

* go over each question you've created and distill the summary into one
    point. An example is 'variable scope: where a variable can be referenced'

* if you need to save something verbatim, capture it in a 'reference' section
    to look over later

* if the lesson has a questions section at the end, write them down and go
    over the questions you got wrong for review

# spot

**study** - get exposure to the topic
  * get to the point where you can explain
  * first sweep

**practice** - build muscle memory
  * practice problems replicate core concepts in code

**over-learn** - pursue edge cases
  * be curious and ask why, look for exceptions to the rule

**teach** - focus on mastery here
  * answer questions
  * explain concepts outside of the original context

# relationships

**relationships**
  * people who know more than you know
  * people who know what you know
  * people who know less than you know

# retain emotional balance

**there is life outside of launch school**
