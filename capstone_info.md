## deposit is 1500

   - 17 weeks
   - some job searches go up to 6 months, but the median time
        for the job search has increased by only 2 - 3 weeks
   - loans are available 

## how do we compete with these guys who have 2 - 4 years of exp?
   - most job descriptions are a WISH LIST
   - most things on that list are negotiable
   - teams take into account "culture fit"
   - 2-4 years serve as a proxy for skills ( its hard to explain this)

   - companies dont know how to think about Capstone projects
   - some companies react positively to capstone projects
   - some companies react negatively to capstone projects
   - people come in with imposter syndrome!
   - technical skills are only ONE part
   - lean into your prior experience!

## applying for software jobs and interviewing is its own skill mannnn
   - you are going to be nervous! ... until you jump in!!

## why do some people get jobs sooner than others?
   - there arent any patterns, sorry!
   - interviewing well helps a lot!
   - people who have some sort of social experience 
   - people who have some sort of tech adjacent experience
